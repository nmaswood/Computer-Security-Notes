# Memory Safety
* Stack basd buffer overflow
    * Writes over the length of its allocated buffer.
    * read until it sees a null terminator
* Overcoming Obstacles
    * Hard to know return address
    * When you smash the stack include return address multiple times
    * Put a  Nop Sled, bfore shell code
* ASLR (address space layout randomization)
    * Randomize memory layout to make exploits hard to write
    * Syscall randomization
    * How to know what maps to what?
# Isolation
*  Protect programs from each other
    * Limit risk to other programs and data form a hijacked program
    * Run code from untrusted sources
* Airgap
    * Network layer isolation, classified network which a bunch of hosts, unclassified network with a bunch of hosts.
    * How to attack airgapped network?
* On same Machine
    * Operation system/ hypervisor
        * hypervisor is basically a virtual machine operating system
        * cannot accesses other processes address apces
    * Application Software
        * share address space
        * interpretd & type space; software fault isolation; proof carrying code
* Process  based isolation
* Virtual Memory
    * Kernel memory can't read or write
    * Stack
    * Shared lib code
    * Heap
    * BSS
    * Data
    * Text
* User mode vs Supervisor Mode
    * Seperating processes of OS Kernel
    * CPU have differetn priviledge levels
    * Priviledged instructions only allowed in supervisor mode
    * syscall or int instructino switches from user mode process to supervisor mode kernel
        * kernel installs syscall & interrupt handlers at boot
* Limit priviledge
    * OS kernel restricts process view of system
    * chroot
        * change root view of the world/ change slash to /tmp/guest you are limited to there
        *  not perfect
* Limiting procesing priviledges
    * jail jail-path hostname cmd
        * More restrictions; network, interprocess communication
    *  Linux
        * Namespaces: process group get its own view of process list, network interfaces, mounts , users, etc
        * Control Groups: limit, priortize & audit process group's resources
    * Docker
        *  Lighterweight VM
* Syscall Interpolation
    * Much damage done via syscalls, monitor process' syscalls and block some
    * ptrace, systrace,AppArmor
    * fine-grained policies
* Interpolation problems
    * Monitor  must keep state
    * Time of check / Time of use Bug
    * Check particular file
* Virtual Machine
* Hypervisor isoltion pro & con
    *  Simple to enforce -> few bugs, smaller attack surface
    * Many added layers slow things down, take a performance hit
* Software Isolation
    * Consumer does not trust producer
    * The producer is the web server the consumer is the client browser
*  Type safe languages
    * All memory accesses are to typed objects enforces encapsulation rules
    * Producer -> Compiler -> Bytecode -> Verifier -> JIT -> Machine Code
* Software Fault Isolation
    * Google NaCl
    * Why not c?
        * Buffer Overflows
