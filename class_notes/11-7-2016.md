# Network Defenses

## Network Eavesdropping
* Passive eavesdropping
    * Fiber tabs, promisc mode, wifi monitor mode, tools, tcpdump, wireshark
* Spoofing
    * Arp Cache poisoning; DHCP spoofing
    * TCP spoofing, reflect attack, syn flooding
    * DNs cache poisoning
    * BGP hijacking
## DNS Cache Poisoning
* Mapping betwen mac and ip
    * name server -> root name server
## DNSSEC
* DNS response signed
* Higher levels vouch for lower levels
* Root zoned signed since July 2010
* Root public key published
* Not universally deployed
## BGP hijacking
* Advertises prefixs, snoop on traffic say i have route when I actually don't
* Censorship, advertise and then drop
* Certificate, sign it
* How do we know the public key of each node
    * IP prefix annoucements signed
    * Routes signed
        *   previous hop authorizes next hop
    * Higher levels ICANN vouch for lower levels
        * e.g. ICANN vouches for ARIN, ARin vouches for AT&T
    * ICANN lives in America
        * Internet Corporation for Asigned names and ...
        * root key is published
## Problems
* Trust
    * Who holds the root key
* Deployment
    * hard to change the internet partial deployment often isnt useful
## SYN Flooding
* Send a lot of SYNS
* Server has to maintain a lot of state
* Never close the connection
* Defense SYN Cookies:
    * server doesn't store state num, instead embdds it in seq num
    * seq = t || m || s
    * t = mod 32
    * m = encoding of max segment size
    * s = prf_k(client IP: port || server IP: port || t)
## Denial of Service (DOS)
* CAPTCHAS
    * Annoying
    * Upload them to another site and have another person solve them for you
## IP Firewall
* Will only permit ingoing or outgoing traffic based on those rules
